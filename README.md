## Summary

</summary>
My name is Nikolai. I am a junior front-end developer.

![Relative date](https://img.shields.io/date/761166000?label=I%20was%20born&style=plastic)

In 2018, I graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute as an aircraft and helicopter engineer. I have been worked in industry since I was a student. 

After 3 years of industry work, I've changed my career. I became a teacher. My professor invited me to take the first steps in this direction.

Sounds crazy, doesn't it? Why should schools hire an engineer as a teacher? The answer is simple: most of Moscow schools need an engineer with "crazy ideas" and the capability to teach. It's my job to come up with an engineering project and implement it with a team of students.

Working at school gave me the opportunity to try many IT directions. I've learned the basics of Python and C++, how to work with Arduino and program microcontrollers using the SPI interface. I've tried myself as DevOps, FrontEND and BackEND developers. I've made my  [IoT](https://grabcad.com/library/convector-patriot-pt-c-15-x-v41-1) , [hardware & software](https://github.com/syrovezhko/developer-keyboard) projects. So, school gave me the opportunity to choose what I really would like to do. Yeh, it‚Äôs front-end. 

I've started by making a website for my study groups. It was a simple multiple page [website](https://syrovezhko.github.io/bootstrap_4_test ) on Bootstrap with manual data updating. In development, I‚Äôve used SASS with Gulp.

For the current academic year (2021-2022), I have made a website using Django 3. It was meant like a private business. But it‚Äôs failed to launch in marketing. By the way, you can checkout the [project](https://github.com/syrovezhko/platform)

On the recommendation of my friend [Vladislav Khorev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladislav-khorev-63a84450) (he is a senior developer in the Luxoft Russia), I‚Äôve started to learn Vue.js. So, I made my first web app project, FullStack app project. I‚Äôve used Vue.js, Express.js, SqLite DB. You may [check out it](https://syrovezhko.github.io/tab-tracker/client/dist), as well.

Previously, I've helped him with GitLab backup. It was my DevOps internship. The goal was to raise the ubuntu server and restore GitLab backup. The backup has been created at legacy 8.15.2 release.In order to restore, I'de should used GitLab not older than 9th release. That was a problem. There were not younger than 13.12 release on the official web site. But I got a way out - the docker container. I've unpacked the container with appropriate GitLab release, restore the backup and started to update the system step by step. The machine was in basic configuration. I've spent a few days for update. Finally, I've created new backup in the latest GitLab release and pushed it to the Amazon cloud.

During this work we realised the Gitea is better for private repositories storage only. So the next task became the new ubuntu server raise, installing and setting up the Gitea, and from GitLab to Gitea repositories migrations also. It was much easier: official docs installation tutorial + python [script](https://github.com/h44z/gitlab_to_gitea).

So to conclude I've created the Gitea backup, pushed it to the Amazon cloud also and melt both of systems. [Vladislav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladislav-khorev-63a84450) removed all machines and gave me the access to the new one, where I've installed Gitea and restored backup normally.

In 2022 I‚Äôve find out a first IT job. There is front-end developer's role in the startup. I made react components for interview preparation system.

Now I'm a Full-stack developer in Transtelematica. My major isthe development of broadcast management systems for public transport screens.

So, that's my story.

Thank you for your attention!
