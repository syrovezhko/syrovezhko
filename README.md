## Summary

</summary>
My name is Nikolai. I am a junior front-end developer.

In 2018, I graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute as an aircraft and helicopter engineer. I have been worked in industry since I was a student. 

After 3 years of industry work, I've changed my career. I became a teacher. My professor invited me to take the first steps in this direction.

Sounds crazy, doesn't it? Why should schools hire an engineer as a teacher? The answer is simple: most of Moscow schools need an engineer with "crazy ideas" and the capability to teach. It's my job to come up with an engineering project and implement it with a team of students.

Working at school gave me the opportunity to try many IT directions. I've learned the basics of Python and C++, how to work with Arduino and program microcontrollers using the SPI interface. I've tried myself as DevOps, FrontEND and BackEND developers. I've made my  [IoT](https://grabcad.com/library/convector-patriot-pt-c-15-x-v41-1) , [hardware & software](https://github.com/syrovezhko/developer-keyboard/tree/software-ru) projects. So, school gave me the opportunity to choose what I really would like to do. Yeh, it‚Äôs front-end. 

I've started by making a website for my study groups. It was a simple multiple page [website](https://syrovezhko.github.io/bootstrap_4_test ) on Bootstrap with manual data updating. In development, I‚Äôve used SASS with Gulp.

For the current academic year (2021-2022), I have made a website using Django 3. It was meant like a private business. But it‚Äôs failed to launch in marketing. By the way, you can checkout the [project](https://github.com/syrovezhko/platform)

On the recommendation of my friend (he is a senior developer in the Luxoft Russia), I‚Äôve started to learn Vue.js. So, I made my first web app project, FullStack app project. I‚Äôve used Vue.js, Express.js, SqLite DB. You may [check out it](https://syrovezhko.github.io/tab-tracker/client/dist), as well.


At the time, I‚Äôve find out The Rolling Scopes School. I think it has become the best part of my self-studying. It made my knowledge better, stronger day to day I believe, I‚Äôm ready for new challenges and projects.

So, that's my story.

Thank you for your attention
